## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The carousel is fully responsive across all device sizes.
- **Autoplay**: The carousel automatically transitions between slides with adjustable timing.
- **Navigation**: Users can navigate manually using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Dot Indicators**: Visual indicators for selecting specific slides, which highlight the current slide.
- **Styled Components**: Modular and reusable CSS-in-JS styling with styled-components.
